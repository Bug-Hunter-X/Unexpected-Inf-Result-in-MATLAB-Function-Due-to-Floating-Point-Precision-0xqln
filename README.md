This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in MATLAB related to floating-point precision. The function `myFunction.m` appears to work correctly for most inputs, but yields an unexpected `Inf` result when the input is exactly 5 due to floating-point precision limitations. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a solution that addresses this issue.  This showcases how seemingly simple calculations can lead to unexpected errors in MATLAB due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic.
